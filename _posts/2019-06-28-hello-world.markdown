Hello World!

My name is John. I'm new to hacking and hope to improve over the next few months. My goal is to earn the OSCP-PWK certification before New Year's Day 2020. Fortunately, I have intermediate experience in programming, IT, and networking.

I'm a cyber systems operator in the Air Force. Recently, I traveled to San Antonio to compete in the [24 AF Cyber Competition](https://www.jbsa.mil/News/News/Article/1873245/24th-air-force-hosts-naf-wide-cyber-competition/). The competition followed the Cyber Panoply format: compromise servers, serve your flag, and defend. My team and I desparately scrambled to learn Kali Linux. By the end, we owned two servers and scored a total of 3 points <sub>(first place had over 3000 points)<sub>.
