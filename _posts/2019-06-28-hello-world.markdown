Hello World!

My name is John. I'm new to hacking and hope to improve over the next few months. My goal is to earn the OSCP-PWK certification before New Year's Day 2020. Fortunately, I have foundational experience in programming, IT, and networking.

I'm a cyber systems operator in the Air Force. Recently, I traveled to San Antonio to compete in the [24 AF Cyber Competition](https://www.jbsa.mil/News/News/Article/1873245/24th-air-force-hosts-naf-wide-cyber-competition/). The competition followed the Cyber Panoply format: compromise servers, serve your flag, and defend. My team and I desparately scrambled to learn Kali Linux. By the end, we owned two servers and scored a total of 3 points <sub>first place had over 3000 points</sub>.

The competition sparked my interest in **hacking**, this mystical realm of cryptography, warfare, and problem-solving. I enrolled in the PWK/OSCP course and dove into the wealth of information on the topic online. The first resource I hit was the [r/oscp](https://www.reddit.com/r/oscp/). I skimmed through the top posts; the following recommendations stood out to me among the mountains of advice:

* [Kernel exploits are not your friend] (https://www.reddit.com/r/oscp/comments/aggzgw/stuff_i_wish_i_knew_before_i_started_my_oscp/) - Don't only rely on easy exploits in labs. Attempt to satisfy the intent of each problem to grow from my time.
* [Start a GitHub pages blog] (https://www.reddit.com/r/oscp/comments/b215lm/another_passed_oscp_newbie_to_oscp/) - Help potential employers get to know me better. Plus, my starting perspectives would be really cool to look back on after I gain more experience.
