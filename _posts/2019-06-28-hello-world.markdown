Hello World!

My name is John. I'm new to hacking and hope to improve over the next few months. My goal is to earn the OSCP-PWK certification before New Year's Day 2020. Fortunately, I have foundational experience in programming, IT, and networking. My toolbet comfortably contains the following skills:

  * PowerShell
  * C#/.NET
  * Windows (registry, firewall, NT, etc.)
  * ADDS
  * Basic Networking (Ports/Prot., IPV4 subnetting, NAT, etc.)

Recently, I traveled to San Antonio to compete in the [24 AF Cyber Competition](https://www.jbsa.mil/News/News/Article/1873245/24th-air-force-hosts-naf-wide-cyber-competition/). The competition followed the Cyber Panoply format: compromise servers, serve your flag, and defend. My team and I desparately scrambled to learn Kali Linux. By the end, we owned two servers and scored a total of 3 points <sub>first place had over 3000 points</sub>.

The competition was a huge leap from my comfort zone but sparked my interest in **hacking** - this mystical realm of cryptography, warfare, and problem-solving. I enrolled in the PWK/OSCP course and dove into the wealth of information on the topic online. The first resource I hit was the [r/oscp](https://www.reddit.com/r/oscp/): I skimmed through the top posts; the following recommendations stood out to me among the mountains of advice:

* [Six months is a realistic goal](https://www.reddit.com/r/oscp/comments/aagrpm/zero_to_oscp_in_four_months/) - The exam is very hard and physically taxing, but I have a similar background to u/TangentialCode. If I put in a similar time and commitment, I can learn the PWK material and pass the exam.
* [Kernel exploits are not your friend](https://www.reddit.com/r/oscp/comments/aggzgw/stuff_i_wish_i_knew_before_i_started_my_oscp/) - Don't only rely on easy exploits in labs. Attempt to satisfy the intent of each problem to grow from my time.
* [Start a GitHub pages blog](https://www.reddit.com/r/oscp/comments/aagrpm/zero_to_oscp_in_four_months/) - Help potential employers get to know me better. Plus, my starting perspectives would be really cool to look back on after I gain more experience.
* [Do report good](https://www.reddit.com/r/oscp/comments/b215lm/another_passed_oscp_newbie_to_oscp/) - I should take many pictures and follow instructions to the T. In addition, I will be conscious of understanding my actions procedurally to support informed/detailed reports.

These posts put me in a growth mindset: learn the techniques, tools, and academics to support my continuous technical progression and inform leaders/teammates for business requirements.

I also watched Hacksploit's videos that went into a variety of hacking topics. The [Lame walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru8YxARNS7M) introduced me to Searchsploit and the general process for engaging vulnerable services. In the 24 AF Cyber Competition, I developed the process of enumerating the network for Windows devices then sweeping ms03, ms01, and ms17 exploits across the list; it was much less flexible than pairing service versions with vulnerabilities in the Metasploit database.

As a starting point, I'm currently armed with tangential cyber skills, Reddit insights, and guidance of seasoned hackers. Before the PWK course starts, I will continue to gather meta knowledge about the competition and familiarize myself with Kali Linux through pentesting labs; this will allow me to hit the ground running and not waste any lab time.

Wish me good luck! Thanks for reading :)
